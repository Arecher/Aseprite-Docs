# Move Selection

After [selecting](selecting.md) a part of the [active cel](cel.md),
you can move the selected area of pixels dragging-and-dropping with
the mouse or using the arrow keys:

![Move selection example](move-selection/move-selection.gif)

If you are moving a region of pixels from the
[background layer](layers.md#background-layer) the selection will be
cleared with the active
[background color](color-bar.md#background-color). If you move a
transparent layer, the region will be cleared with the transparent
color.

When moving a selection, you can find transform options in the [context bar](context-bar.md).

![context bar example](move-selection/contextbar.png)

- X-position
- Y-position
- Width
- Height
- Rotation
- Skew

These values can be edited through the context bar or by [transforming](transformations.md).
